A description of your project

This is my Code Louisville project telling a short history about how to best connect Bowling Green neighborhoods as well as help the user realize how much of their time is spent driving to workgit . We are focusing on the Kentucky city of Bowling Green and Louisville and analyzing maps of the road connections. 

The link on Github Pages is (link[https://jodydahmer.github.io/bg_maps/])

Check out our previous map work at Beargrassthunder.com (link[https://www.beargrassthunder.com])
This project is using my research and expertise in cartography (mapmaking) to show hidden disparities in Bowling Green, KY Transit and transportation.
 
What features you chose to include (so we know what to look for)

1. Image carousel with 3 images that rotate through (See revised.css)
2. Use CSS Grid to rearrange 2 or more content areas on your page as the screen changes sizes (See revised.css)
3. Use media queries to switch from a one-column mobile layout to a two or more column desktop layout (See revised.css)
4. Create and populate a JavaScript array, then retrieve and display one or more values from it ( See grid.js)
5. Use JavaScript to perform math operations and display the result on your site ( I printed the prompt value in top left corner of page)


Any special instructions we might need to run your project?

 Media Queries are supposed to move the nav bar to underneath the header
 Javascript will issue a prompt at onload of page, may need to scroll up to top in order to see where it is printed. 


The javascript file is grid.js and contains math equations , arrays, carousel information.


Big shout out to the Code Louisville team and many many MANY thanks for all the assistance on getting my code to work. Literally could not have done this without you.
