A description of your project

This project is using my research and expertise in cartography (mapmaking) to show hidden disparities in Bowling Green, KY Transit and transportation.
 
What features you chose to included (so we know what to look for)

1. Image carousel with 3 images that rotate through
2. Use CSS Grid to rearrange 2 or more content areas on your page as the screen changes sizes
3. Nth Child CSS:   border around every 2nd child of parent div tag
4.Use media queries to switch from a one-column mobile layout to a two or more column desktop layout 
5.Create and populate a JavaScript array, then retrieve and display one or more values from it
6. Use JavaScript to perform math operations and display the result on your site
Any special instructions we might need to run your project



This is my Code Louisville project using maps to tell a story about how to best connect Louisville neighborhoods. We are focusing on the Kentucky city of Bowling Green and Louisville and analyzing maps of the road connections.
