<p>How many roads connect Bowling Green and Louisville?</p>

<p>Historically during the mid to late 1800s, working class Catholic, Jewish, and Black Louisvillians lived nearest the floodplain of Beargrass Creek due to most of the land already being claimed by Protestant white settlers a few decades prior.  Today these historic working class neighborhoods became what is known as the Smoketown, Paristown Pointe, Germantown-Paristown, Shelby Park, Original Highlands and Schnitzelburg communities, easily identified by the abundance of historic shotgun style homes.
    Overtime, restrictions were put in place to ban black residents from owning houses in the majority-white and wealthier sections of town and decisions were made by white politicians that severely impacted the lives and livelihoods of black neighborhoods across Louisville.
    We can see this directly by looking at the 2010 Census data, available from the Cooper Center at the University of Virginia.
    State controlled highways </p>

    <p>Most of the roads in majority black neighborhoods are one-way streets with high speed limits. These roads are designated state highways, meaning it is impossible to change them at the local level and need approval from the majority-white state government. Currently, every road south of Broadway connecting majority-white to majority black neighborhoods (Breckinridge, Kentucky, Oak) is a one-way street when it reaches majority-black neighborhoods of Smoketown, Shelby Park, and California.
    Shelby Street is a one way, then a two-way for a couple blocks, and then a one-way street again right after.
    Poplar Level Road, a two way street in majority white Germantown becomes a one-way at Logan St. in Shelby Park and Smoketown before becoming a dead-end at Broadway.
    Campbell Street is closed off to through traffic from majority-black Smoketown. Preston Street and Floyd Street were disconnected at the railroad, meaning there is no way for freight to get to Preston Highway.
    Severed Historical Connections</p>

    There were three bridges over Beargrass Creek to present-day majority-black neighborhoods on Barret Ave/Chestnut, Finzer, and Lampton) that were demolished by the city or state government.
    As of today (6/8/20), I have not received notice from Public Works regarding historical documents or data that can give the reason why all bridges connecting majority-white to majority- black neighbohoods (Chestnut, Finzer, Lampton)  were systematically destroyed but all bridges connecting majority white neighborhoods (Schiller, Swan, Ellison) were left intact and two-way.
    One-Way Roads in Black Neighborhoods/Two-Way in White
    Two roads (Breckinridge, Grinstead/Oak) connecting Bardstown Road to Smoketown and Shelby Park are two-way streets in majority-white neighborhoods, but one-way in Smoketown and Shelby Park.  
  
  <h3>Railroad Access</h3>  

    <p>The railroad prevents any cross traffic between majority-white neighborhoods until it gets to Broadway and Breckinridge. Currently, the only direction you can go on Breckinridge is West, away from majority-white neighborhoods.
    Concrete Ditch vs Healthy Creek
    Beargrass Creek is a creek in majority white neighborhoods along Poplar Level Road as well as majority white Butchertown but is channelized into a concrete ditch as it flows through Germantown and Smoketown.
    Currently, a study is underway by the Army Corps to restore Beargrass Creek, but we need to keep pushing for ways for residents to cross in order to access amenities and safer paths home. This can be a way to heal past transgressions against minority communities.</p>
