        <h1> Why does accessibility through roads matter?</h1>

         <p> Roads are meant to get people, us, and our families to wherever we want to go . For most people, that means speeding as fast as you can to get to your parking lot as quickly as possible. <p></p>
             <p>Remember that the car wasn't widely available until the 20th century, meaning that for Kentuckians to get around, they needed some different infrastructure<p>Kentucky History goes WAY back. The state was founded in (X) , and Bowling Green was founded in (X). </p>

    <div class="item Railroad">

        <p>Originally, the railroad was the economic center of Bowling Green. As a result, neighborhoods on either side of the tracks like Delafield began to form. The railroad offered direct routes to Nashville and Louisville within a short walk of their home. 

        <p>Railroads cut off section of town due to their nature. However ,this burden of crossings does not affect all city residents equally.  </p>
    
        <p>For many families, multiple cars are out of the budget. As a result, these residents lose access to stores and locations that BG Transit currently doesn’t have stations. </p>

    </div>

    <div class="item important">
        <h3>Why does accessibility through roads matter?</h3>

        <p> Our roads need to take care of everyone in the city, especially our children and senior residents. For many families, multiple cars are out of the budget. Taking out car loans and going deeper into dept is a reality for many young families that otherwise lose access to other neighbrohoods </p>
            </p>
    </div>
    <div class="item divides">
        <h3>Hidden Divides in our Cities</h3>
        <p>Some divides are natural, like a creek or river. Others are man-made. The railroad and interstate highways often leave residents without a car stranded on one side of the tracks. Without any motivation to connect these neighborhoods, once our seniors get too old to drive this could mean they lose access to family , shopping, and most importantly connection to others.</p>
    
    </div>
    <div class="item possible">
        <h3>Transit Possibilities and Issues</h3>

           <p> There are only 11 roads in the city that cross the railroad tracks. </p>
            <p>The residents of Bowling Green need to be able to get between our neighborhoods safely and quickly. Our elderly and disabled residents deserve to be able to get connected to essential services.</p>            
            <p>There are only 19 roads in the city limits that cross the railroad tracks within Bowling Green city limits. Of those 19, only 5 roads allow for “grade separation” where cars and trains to cross at the same time .</p>
           <article> You can see from the map that the North BG neighborhoods and Shake Rag neighborhood are isolated from the rest of BG transit lines and must take a circulator path in order to get to a central “hub”. This will get residents to the destination and will service a wide area of the neighborhood, but it will NOT be fast. 
            When we lose neighborhood connections, we lose a sense of belonging. A trip to the grocery store or to the park for baseball practice can seem almost impossible. A family with two children may not be able to afford two  “Sweet 16” presents of a car in order to  give their child the best opportunities for work and education.  
        
            We also need to think of our seniors.  If we have to have a car for basic necessities, what are seniors-- our parents-- going to do when they become too old to drive but want to maintain an independent life in the house they still own?

        <h3>Coronavirus Kicker</h3>

            <p>With more and more residents increasingly isolated and staying at home, we need ways for residents to exercise and still get to where they need to go safely.  A four foot sidewalk is not going to be safe anymore. How are you going to stand 6’ apart on a four foot sidewalk?</p>
            
            We need to be thinking of better mobility solutions here for Bowling Green to benefit all residents and help encourage local businesses to stay open.

        <article>
            Bowling Green has a grid downtown, but it is used inefficiently. As a result, neighborhoods and residents are isolated from one another and as a result all commerce suffers. By building a connected city, we can decrease the time it takes to move around Bowling Green, and incentivize smart development along the main corridors of our city.
